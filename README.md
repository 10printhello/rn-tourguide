[Demo](https://expo.io/@mohebifar/copilot-example)

## Installation
```
npm install --save react-native-copilot
```

## Usage
Use the `copilot()` higher order component for the screen component that you want to use copilot with:

```js
import { copilot } from 'react-native-copilot';

class HomeScreen extends Component { /* ... */ }

export default copilot()(HomeScreen);
```

Before defining walkthrough steps for your react elements, you must make them `copilotable`. The easiest way to do that for built-in react native components, is using the `copilotable` HOC. Then you must wrap the element with `CopilotStep`.

```js
import { copilot, copilotable, CopilotStep } from 'react-native-copilot';

const CopilotText = copilotable(Text);

class HomeScreen {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <CopilotStep text="This is a hello world example!" order={1} name="hello">
          <CopilotText>Hello world!</CopilotText>
        </CopilotStep>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

Every `CopilotStep` must have these props:

1. **name**: A unique name for the walkthrough step.
2. **order**: A positive number indicating the order of the step in the entire walkthrough.
3. **text**: The text shown as the description for the step.

### Custom components as steps
The components wrapped inside `CopilotStep`, will receive a `copilot` prop of type `Object` which the outermost rendered element of the component or the element that you want the tooltip be shown around, must extend.

```js
import { copilot, CopilotStep } from 'react-native-copilot';

const CustomComponent = ({ copilot }) => <View {...copilot}><Text>Hello world!</Text></View>;

class HomeScreen {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <CopilotStep text="This is a hello world example!" order={1} name="hello">
          <CustomComponent />
        </CopilotStep>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
