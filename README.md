[Demo](https://expo.io/@mohebifar/joyride-example)

## Installation
```
npm install --save react-native-joyride
```

## Usage
Use the `joyride()` higher order component for the screen component that you want to use joyride with:

```js
import { joyride } from 'react-native-joyride';

class HomeScreen extends Component { /* ... */ }

export default joyride()(HomeScreen);
```

Before defining walkthrough steps for your react elements, you must make them `joyridable`. The easiest way to do that for built-in react native components, is using the `joyridable` HOC. Then you must wrap the element with `JoyrideStep`.

```js
import { joyride, joyridable, JoyrideStep } from 'react-native-joyride';

const JoyrideText = joyridable(Text);

class HomeScreen {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <JoyrideStep text="This is a hello world example!" order={1} name="hello">
          <JoyrideText>Hello world!</JoyrideText>
        </JoyrideStep>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

Every `JoyrideStep` must have these props:

1. **name**: A unique name for the walkthrough step.
2. **order**: A positive number indicating the order of the step in the entire walkthrough.
3. **text**: The text shown as the description for the step.

### Custom components as steps
The components wrapped inside `JoyrideStep`, will receive a `joyride` prop of type `Object` which the outermost rendered element of the component or the element that you want the tooltip be shown around, must extend.

```js
import { joyride, JoyrideStep } from 'react-native-joyride';

const CustomComponent = ({ joyride }) => <View {...joyride}><Text>Hello world!</Text></View>;

class HomeScreen {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <JoyrideStep text="This is a hello world example!" order={1} name="hello">
          <CustomComponent />
        </JoyrideStep>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
